/*We want to estimate the cost of painting a property
 * Interior wall painting cost is Rs.18 per sq.ft. and exterior wall painting cost is Rs.12 per sq.ft.
 * Take input as
 * 1. Number of Interior walls
 * 2. Number of Exterior walls
 * 3. Surface Area of each Interior Wall in units of square feet
 * 4. Surface Area of each Exterior Wall in units of square feet
 * If a user enters zero  as the number of walls then skip Surface area values as User may donâ€™t  want to paint that wall.
 * Calculate and display the total cost of painting the property
 * Example 1:
 * 6
 * 3
 * 12.3
 * 15.2
 * 12.3
 * 15.2
 * 12.3
 * 15.2
 * 10.10
 * 10.10
 * 10.00
 * Total estimated Cost : 1847.4 INR*/
